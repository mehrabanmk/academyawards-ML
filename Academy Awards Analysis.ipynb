    "We can see that it guessed correctly that 147 entries did not win award and 41 entries who won awards. It made few mistakes where person had not won award but model predicted it did for 7 entries and where the nominee actually won an award but our model predicted that it did not for 18 entries.\n",

    "Say for example we take yellow cell, when you hover over it, it says z=147. if you look at Y axis it says `Actual - 0` and X axis says `Predicted - 0`. This means that for 147 rows actual value was 0 and model also predicted 0. It means that for 147 person/movie had lost award and our model also predicted same. We can interpret other cells in same way.\n",
